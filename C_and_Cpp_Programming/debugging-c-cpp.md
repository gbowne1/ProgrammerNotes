# Debugging C and C++ code

Debugging C and C++ code is an essential and some would say critical skill for any C/C++programmer.

Here's a breakdown of the key techniques:

Understanding the Problem:

Unexpected Output: If the program's output significantly differs from what you expect, there's a bug.
Crashing Program: A program that crashes abruptly indicates a serious issue.

Using Print Statements:

Insert printf statements (C) or cout statements (C++) at strategic points in your code.
Print the values of variables to track their changes during execution.
This helps verify if variables hold the intended values at each step.

Debuggers:

GDB (GNU Debugger): A powerful command-line debugger for Linux and Unix-based systems.
LLDB: A modern debugger often used on macOS.
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Many IDEs like Visual Studio and Code::Blocks have built-in debuggers with graphical interfaces.

Methods used in debugging

- Set breakpoints at specific lines to pause program execution and examine the state.
- Execute code one line at a time or step into functions to see how they behave.
- View the values of variables at any point during execution.
- See the sequence of function calls that led to the current execution point.  This is the call stack.

Debugging Tips:

    My suggestion for beginners in C/C++ to begin by isolating the problematic section of code.
    Add comments to explain your thought process and debugging steps.
    Explain your code to an imaginary listener (like a rubber duck) to identify flaws. This is the rubber duck method
    Write unit tests to verify the functionality of smaller code blocks.  Unit testing is a more advanced topic.  I would not worry about this as a beginner until you have had more experience.  However, running and testing your program(s), trying out and testing how it runs
    As a beginner, most of your bugs will be syntactical or missing special symbols or the symbols in the wrong place(s)

When faced with a bug, a good debugging strategy is to:

- Reproduce the issue reliably
- Use debugger tools to understand what's happening
- Analyze the root cause of the problem
- Fix the bug and test the solution



By effectively combining these techniques, you'll be well-equipped to tackle debugging challenges in your C and C++ project
