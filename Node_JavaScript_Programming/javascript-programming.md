# Introduction to JavaScript Programming

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that is essential for web development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. Whether you are using a Mac, Linux, or Windows computer, JavaScript is a fundamental skill for anyone interested in programming.

## Understanding JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is known for its flexibility and is primarily used to enhance the interactivity of web pages. JavaScript can be used on both the client-side and server-side of web development. The filename extension is `.js`.

One should be using the latest version of the ES standard for JavaScript, however there are 3 more common ones used in most projects and they are:
ES5, ES6 and ES7.

## ES5, ES6, and ES7

ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was the fifth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which JavaScript is based on. It introduced many new features and improvements to the language. ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, brought significant enhancements to JavaScript, including arrow functions, classes, and template literals. ES7, or ECMAScript 2016, and subsequent versions continued to add new features and improvements to the language

The differences between ES5, ES6, and ES7 in JavaScript can be summarized as follows:

ES5, Also known as ECMAScript 2009, released in 2009.

    Variables: Only one way to define variables using the var keyword.
    Performance: Lower performance compared to ES6.
    Object Manipulation: Time-consuming compared to ES6.
    Function Definition: Both function and return keywords are used to define a function.
    Support: Supports primitive data types such as string, number, boolean, null, and undefined.

ES6, Also known as ECMAScript 2015, released in 2015.

    Variables: Introduces two new ways to define variables: let and const.
    Performance: Higher performance than ES5.
    Object Manipulation: Less time-consuming compared to ES5.
    Function Definition: Introduces arrow functions, eliminating the need for the function keyword in some cases.
    Data Types: Adds a new primitive data type, symbol, for supporting unique values.

ES7, Also known as ECMAScript 2016.

    Features: Builds upon ES6 and introduces new features such as async/await, exponentiation operator, and more.
    Transpilation: Requires transpilation to convert ES7 code to ES5 for compatibility with browsers.
    Spread Operator: Introduces the spread operator (...) for merging arrays and objects.
    Template Literal: Introduces template literals using backticks (`) for easy string interpolation.

## Learning JavaScript

To start learning JavaScript, it's important to understand the basic syntax and concepts of the language. Once you have a good grasp of the fundamentals, you can explore the new features introduced in ES6 and ES7.

These features include:

- Arrow functions
- Classes
- Template literals
- Async/await
- Spread and rest operators
- Destructuring assignments
- Promises

By understanding these features, you can write more efficient and modern JavaScript code.

In conclusion, JavaScript is a powerful language that continues to evolve with new features and improvements. Whether you are new to programming or have some experience, learning JavaScript and its latest versions, ES6 and ES7, will open up a world of possibilities for web development.

Here are 12 concepts to learn in ES5, ES6, and ES7 JavaScript programming:

Fundamentals: Understanding the basic syntax, data types, and control structures in JavaScript.

- Operators: Learning about arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other operators used in JavaScript.

- Control Flow: Understanding conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while) to control the flow of a program.

- Arrays: Exploring array manipulation, iteration, and new methods introduced in ES6 and ES7.

- Functions: Mastering the concept of functions, including arrow functions introduced in ES6.

Arrow Functions only exist in ES6 and ES7 Javascript.

Here is an example of an arrow function:

    ```js
    var multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
    ```

- Objects: Understanding object-oriented programming in JavaScript, including object creation, manipulation, and ES6 class syntax.

- Prototypes: Learning about prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript, a fundamental concept in ES5 and ES6.

- Patterns to Create Objects: Exploring different patterns for creating objects, including factory functions and constructor functions.

- Error Handling: Understanding error handling techniques, including try-catch blocks and error objects.

- Promises: Learning about asynchronous programming and handling asynchronous operations using promises, introduced in ES6.

- Template Literals: Exploring the new syntax for creating strings and performing string interpolation introduced in ES6.

- Modules: Understanding the concept of modules for organizing and importing/exporting code, a feature introduced in ES6 for improved modularity and reusability.

## Javascript program / application entrypoint

The typical filenames for JavaScript program entry points are "index.js," "app.js," and "main.js".

These names are commonly used, but the choice is ultimately up to the developer. According to the
Google JavaScript Style Guide, file names for JavaScript must be all lowercase and may include
underscores or dashes, but no additional punctuation, and the filename extension must be .js.

Some JavaScript frameworks will require certain entrypoint filenames.  This is also common in
JavaScript frameworks, especially NodeJS and React.

## Filenames and Variable casing

What are the various filename case are used in javascript?

Well, in JavaScript, the common naming conventions for file names are all lowercase with the option to use underscores (_) or dashes (-)

This means that file names must be all lowercase and may include underscores or dashes, but no additional punctuation. For example, "my_file_name.js" or "my-file-name.js" are both valid file names in JavaScript. It is important to follow the convention that your project uses

There is no official, universal convention for naming JavaScript files, but it is crucial to be consistent in the convention you choose.

In JavaScript, there are several naming conventions used for variables, functions, classes, and file names. The two most common naming conventions for file names are PascalCase and kebab-case. PascalCase uses capital letters at the beginning of each word, without spaces or punctuation, while kebab-case uses all lowercase letters and hyphens between words. For example, "MyFile.js" is in PascalCase, and "my-file.js" is in kebab-case

For variables and functions, the most common convention is camelCase, which uses a lowercase letter at the beginning of the name and capital letters for each new word, without spaces or punctuation. For example, "myVariable" and "myFunction" are in camelCase.

It is important to be consistent and follow the convention that your project uses. It is also a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and files to improve code readability and maintainability

## Functions and Classes

Here are examples of JavaScript functions and classes in ES5, ES6, and ES7:

ES5

    // Function in ES5
    var myFunction = function() {
    // function body
    };

    // Class in ES5 (using constructor function)
    function MyClass() {
      this.property = value;
      this.method = function() {
    // method body
     };
    }

ES6

    // Function in ES6 (using arrow function)
    const myFunction = () => {
    // function body
    };

    // Class in ES6
    class MyClass {
        constructor() {
        this.property = value;
    }
    method() {
    // method body
      }
    }

ES7

    // Function in ES7 (using async/await)
    const myFunction = async () => {
    // function body
    };

    // Class in ES7 (using class properties)
    class MyClass {
        property = value;
    method = () => {
    // method body
      };
    }

A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. It is similar to a procedure and can take input and return an output. Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be passed to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables and properties. There are several ways to define a function in JavaScript, including function declaration and function expression. JavaScript also has special syntaxes for defining arrow functions and methods. Functions can be invoked when an event occurs, called from JavaScript code, or automatically invoked. When a function reaches a return statement, it stops executing and returns a value. Functions are essential for writing concise, modular, reusable, and maintainable code in JavaScript

## JavaScript classes

 Classes in JavaScript are a way to create objects using a template. They were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a cleaner way to follow object-oriented programming patterns. JavaScript is a prototype-based language, and classes are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes. Here are some key points about classes in JavaScript:

    Definition: Classes are defined using the class keyword, and they can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.

    Constructor: The constructor method is a special method that is executed automatically when a new object is created from a class. It is used to initialize object properties.

    Methods: Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods. They are defined within the class and can be called on objects created from the class.

    Static Methods and Fields: Classes can also have static methods and static fields, which are shared by all instances of the class.
    Private Properties: Private fields can be used to define private properties within a class, which are not accessible from outside the class.

Classes in JavaScript provide a more structured way to create and work with objects, and they are especially useful for implementing object-oriented programming concepts.

To use JavaScript classes, you can follow these steps:

Declaring a Class: Use the class keyword followed by the class name. Always add a constructor() method, which is used to initialize object properties.

Adding Methods: You can add any number of methods to the class using the same syntax as object methods.

Creating Objects: Once you have a class, you can use it to create objects by using the new keyword followed by the class name and any necessary arguments for the constructor.

Here's an example of a simple class in JavaScript:

    class Car {
      constructor(name, year) {
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
      }
      age() {
        const date = new Date();
        return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
      }
    }

    const myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);console.log(myCar.age());

Classes in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a cleaner way to follow object-oriented programming patterns. They are mainly an abstraction over the existing prototypical inheritance mechanism, and all patterns are convertible to prototype-based inheritance

It is widely accepted to use classes in JavaScript, and they are not deprecated

## Tabs, spaces, brackets, semicolons: JavaScript formatting

Usage of tabs and spaces in Javascript is talked about a lot.

The debate between using tabs and spaces in JavaScript (and other programming languages) has been ongoing for some time. Here are some key points from the search results

Tabs: Tabs are considered by some to be the democratic way to handle white space, as anyone can set them up how they like them. They are also descriptive, telling the editor the amount of indentation that should be added

Spaces: Spaces are displayed visually the same across any system, ensuring consistency. Different platforms and editors may display tabs with varying sizes, leading to potential issues with code alignment and readability

Debate: The debate between tabs and spaces is not just about personal preference, but also about consistency, readability, and potential issues with code alignment and display across different platforms and editors

The choice between tabs and spaces is ultimately a matter of personal or team preference, as both can be used effectively. Consistency within a codebase is key, regardless of whether tabs or spaces are chosen for indentation

## Linting JavaScript

The most common linter used for JavaScript is ESLint. A linter will help you keep your JavaScript code at least partially consistent.  Configuring the linter is beyond the scope of this text.

Linting JavaScript and TypeScript applications offers several benefits, including:

- Fewer Errors: Linters help identify and fix potential issues, such as code smells, before they manifest as critical problems in a production environment.

- Consistent and Readable Code: Linting encourages adherence to coding standards and best practices, leading to more maintainable and consistent code

- Early Error Detection: Linters catch errors early in the development process, making them easier and less costly to fix

- Promotion of Best Practices: They promote the use of coding standards and best practices within a development team, ensuring that the codebase is of high quality and follows established guidelines

- Identifying Security Vulnerabilities: Linting can help identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code, reducing the risk of a breach

While it may seem that the applications you are working on function without any problems despite the linting errors, using a linter is still recommended due to the aforementioned benefits. It not only helps in maintaining code quality but also fosters a culture of best practices and consistency.

Linting JavaScript code offers several benefits, including:

    Error Prevention: Linting helps identify and eliminate common errors and problematic code patterns, such as the use of undeclared variables, calls to undefined or deprecated functions, and potential syntax issues. This proactive approach reduces the likelihood of bugs and errors before the code is executed, leading to more reliable and stable applications

    Code Quality: By enforcing coding standards and best practices, linting contributes to the overall quality and readability of the code. It helps maintain a consistent coding style across the codebase, making the code easier to understand and maintain for the entire development team

    Improved Code Review: Linting facilitates more productive code review discussions by automatically flagging potential issues, allowing developers to focus on higher-level design and architecture considerations rather than getting bogged down in trivial, easily preventable error

    Enhanced Developer Experience: Linting encourages the writing of clean and well-structured code, which can lead to a more enjoyable and efficient development experience. Developers can benefit from immediate feedback on their code, leading to faster identification and resolution of issues

## Inline scripting

You can do JavaScript inline in a HTML file by using the `<script>` tag and it needs a closing `</script>` tag to be valid at the end of the script.

You can place this script tag at any point in the HTML, however, for some performance gains the script tag should be placed at the end of the html file, just before the closing `</body>` tag.

Other than this, it is a lot more maintainable to just include the JavaScript code in a separate file, with the extension `.js` and call it from the HTML file.

## Try and Catch

To use try...catch in different versions of JavaScript, you can follow these guidelines:

In ES5, you can use the traditional try...catch syntax to handle exceptions.

 try {
 // Code that may throw an exception
 } catch (error) {
 // Handling the exception
 }

In ES6 and later versions, the try...catch syntax remains the same. However, new features have been added to the language, but the basic try...catch functionality remains consistent across these versions

For example, in ES2019, optional catch binding was introduced, allowing you to omit the binding if you don't need to use the error object:

 try {
 // Code that may throw an exception
 } catch {
 // Handling the exception
 }

In summary, the try...catch syntax is consistent across ES5, ES6, and later versions of JavaScript, with some additional features introduced in the later versions

## Debugging JavaScript

The `console.log` statement should be used for debugging in the browser console for JavaScript by sending logged and logged error output to the console.

ESLint is also a good tool to be used for debugging JavaScript.

Chrome has built in DevTools for debugging

Node.js has its own debugger and debugger port for it's JavaScript.

## JavaScript Arrays

In JavaScript, an array is a single variable used to store multiple elements of different data types. It is a special type of object that allows for the storage of a collection of items under a single variable name. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, resizable, and can contain a mix of different data types. They are not associative arrays, so their elements are accessed using nonnegative integers as indexes. Arrays in JavaScript use numbered indexes, and their elements can be accessed by referring to an index number. Here are some key points about JavaScript arrays:

    JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays, although the typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays

    They are zero-indexed, meaning the first element of an array is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on, with the last element at the value of the array's length property minus 12

    Arrays can be created using array literals or the JavaScript new keyword

    They are not associative in nature, and their elements are accessed using nonnegative integers as indexes

    JavaScript arrays can hold different types of data and are used to store multiple values under a single variable name

You can add elements to an array in JavaScript using the push(), unshift(), splice(), and concat() methods. Here's a brief overview of each method:

Using push(): This method adds one or more elements to the end of an array.

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 3];
    array.push(4, 5);
    // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

Using unshift(): It adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 3];
    array.unshift(0);
    // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    ```

Using splice(): This method can add elements at any specified position in the array.

     ```js
     let array = [1, 2, 3];
     array.splice(1, 0, 4, 5);
     // Output: [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]
     ```

Using concat(): It creates a new array by merging existing arrays.

    ```js
    let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let array2 = [4, 5];
    let newArray = array1.concat(array2);
    // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

Removing Elements from an Array in JavaScript

To remove elements from an array in JavaScript, you can use the pop(), shift(), splice(), or filter() methods. Here's a brief overview of each method:

    Using pop(): This method removes the last element from an array.
    Using shift(): It removes the first element from an array.
    Using splice(): This method can remove elements from any specified position in the array.
    Using filter(): It creates a new array with elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Looping Through an Array in JavaScript
You can loop through an array in JavaScript using various methods such as for loop, forEach(), for...of loop, and map() method. Here's a brief overview of each method:

Using for loop:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        // Access each element using array[i]
    }
    ```

Using forEach():

    ```js
    array.forEach(function(element) {
    // Access each element using element
    });
    ```

Using for...of loop:

    ```js
    for (let element of array) {
    // Access each element using element
    }
    ```

Using map():

    ```js
    let newArray = array.map(function(element) {
    // Perform operations on each element and return the result
    });
    ```

These methods provide flexibility in adding, removing, and iterating through elements in JavaScript arrays

To remove all elements from an array in JavaScript, you can set the array's length to 0 or use the splice() method. Here's how to do it:

    Setting the Array's Length to 0:

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    array.length = 0;
    // Output: []
    ```

Using the splice() Method:

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    array.splice(0, array.length);
    // Output: []
    ```

Checking if an Element Exists in an Array in JavaScript

You can check if an element exists in an array in JavaScript using the includes() method or the indexOf() method. Here's how to do it:

Using the includes() Method:

    ```javascript
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    array.includes(3);
    // Output: true
    ```

Using the indexOf() Method:

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    array.indexOf(3) !== -1;
    // Output: true
    ```

Sorting an Array in JavaScript

You can sort an array in JavaScript using the sort() method. By default, the sort() method sorts the elements as strings in alphabetical and ascending order. Here's how to use it:

    ```js
    const array = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5];
    array.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    // Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

The sort() method can be customized to sort elements in a different order, such as descending order, by providing a compare function

These methods provide a way to remove elements, check for the existence of elements, and sort arrays in JavaScript.

To remove duplicates from an array in JavaScript, you can use the filter() method in combination with the indexOf() method. Here's how to do it:

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
      let uniqueArray = array.filter((value, index, self) => {
      return self.indexOf(value) === index;
    });
    // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

This code creates a new array by filtering out duplicate elements from the original array.

Reversing an Array in JavaScript

You can reverse the elements of an array in JavaScript using the reverse() method. Here's an example:

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    array.reverse();
    // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    ```

The reverse() method changes the original array by reversing its elements in place.

Shuffling an Array in JavaScript

There are multiple ways to shuffle an array in JavaScript. One common approach is to use the Fisher-Yates algorithm. Here's an example of shuffling an array using this algorithm:

    ```js
    function shuffleArray(array) {
      for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
      }
      return array;
    }

    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let shuffledArray = shuffleArray(array);
    // Output: A shuffled version of the original array
    ```

The Fisher-Yates algorithm provides a truly random shuffle of the array elements

These methods offer effective ways to remove duplicates, reverse, and shuffle arrays in JavaScript.

Here are the various methods to remove duplicates from an array in JavaScript:

Using Set Object

You can use the Set object to remove duplicates from an array in JavaScript. Here's an example:

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
    let uniqueArray = [...new Set(array)];
    // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

The Set object automatically removes duplicate values, providing a simple and efficient way to obtain the unique elements of an array.

Using Filter Method

The filter() method can also be used to remove duplicates from an array. Here's an example:

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
    let uniqueArray = array.filter((value, index) => array.indexOf(value) === index);
    // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

The filter() method creates a new array of elements that pass the condition provided, effectively removing duplicates.
Using Reduce Method

The reduce() method can be employed to remove duplicates from an array. Here's an example:

    ```js
    let array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
    let uniqueArray = array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
      if (!accumulator.includes(currentValue)) {
        accumulator.push(currentValue);
      }
      return accumulator;
    }, []);
    // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

The reduce() method is used to reduce the elements of the array and combine them into a final array based on a reducer function. These methods provide different approaches to removing duplicates from an array in JavaScript

The main difference between using Set and Filter to remove duplicates from an array in JavaScript lies in the approach and the resulting output. Here's a brief comparison:

    Using Set:
        The Set object automatically removes duplicate values from an array, providing a simple and efficient way to obtain the unique elements of the array.
        The output is a Set, which needs to be converted back to an array using the spread operator or the Array.from method.
        The Set approach is concise and directly handles the removal of duplicates without the need for additional conditions.
    Using Filter:
        The filter() method creates a new array of elements that pass the condition provided, effectively removing duplicates.
        The output is an array containing the unique elements that satisfy the condition specified in the filter() method.
        The filter() approach requires the explicit definition of the condition for removing duplicates, which involves comparing the index of the current element with the index of its first occurrence in the array.

    The Set approach provides a more direct and concise method for removing duplicates, while the Filter approach offers more flexibility in defining the condition for removing duplicates.

Removing Duplicates from an Array of Objects in JavaScript Using Set Object

You can remove duplicates from an array of objects in JavaScript using the Set object. Here's an example:

    ```js
    let arrayOfObjects = [{id: 1, name: 'John'}, {id: 2, name: 'Jane'}, {id: 1, name: 'John'}];
    let uniqueArray = Array.from(new Set(arrayOfObjects.map(obj => JSON.stringify(obj)))).map(str => JSON.parse(str));
    // Output: [{id: 1, name: 'John'}, {id: 2, name: 'Jane'}]
    ```

This code uses the JSON.stringify method to convert each object to a string, then leverages the Set object to remove duplicates based on the string representation, and finally converts the unique strings back to objects.

Removing Duplicates from an Array of Objects in JavaScript Using Filter Method

You can also remove duplicates from an array of objects in JavaScript using the filter() method. Here's an example:

    ```js
    let arrayOfObjects = [{id: 1, name: 'John'}, {id: 2, name: 'Jane'}, {id: 1, name: 'John'}];
    let uniqueArray = arrayOfObjects.filter((obj, index, self) =>
       index === self.findIndex((t) => (t.id === obj.id && t.name === obj.name))
    );
    // Output: [{id: 1, name: 'John'}, {id: 2, name: 'Jane'}]
    ```

This code uses the filter() method in combination with the findIndex() method to create a new array containing only the first occurrence of each unique object. The Set object and the filter() method provide effective ways to remove duplicates from an array of objects in JavaScript, each with its own advantages and considerations
