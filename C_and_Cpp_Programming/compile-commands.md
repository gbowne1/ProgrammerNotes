# CMake Compile Commands

There is a file called `compile_commands.json`

`compile_commands.json` is a JSON-formatted file that contains structured data about every compilation unit in a project. It specifies how to replay single compilations independently of the build system1
. The file consists of an array of "command objects," where each command object specifies one way a translation unit is built

The compile_commands.json file is used by various tools, such as IDEs and static analysis tools, to obtain information about the build process, such as include paths and compilation flags, that is necessary for their operation

The file is usually generated by build systems, such as CMake, and put at the top of the build directory

The CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS flag can be used with CMake to generate the compile_commands.json file, just set it to `ON` like

In your `CMakeLists.txt`  file you can generate this file if you include this:

`set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)`

It is normally a generated file by cmake when you run a cmake build and will normally look like this:

```json
[
 {
  "directory": "/home/user/project",
  "command": "gcc -Iinclude -c src/file1.c -o obj/file1.o",
  "file": "src/file1.c"
 },
]
```
