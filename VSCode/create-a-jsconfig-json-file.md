# Create a jsconfig.json

The `jsconfig.json` file is used with Visual Studio Code. It is used to configure JavaScript projects in Visual Studio Code. The `jsconfig.json` file specifies the root files and options for the features provided by the JavaScript language service. The presence of a `jsconfig.json` file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a JavaScript project. The file itself lists the files belonging to the project as well as compiler options.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
  "target": "es6",
  "module": "es6",
  "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude":["node_modules"]
}
```

There is also a `tsconfig.json` file that configures Typescript in Visual Studio Code and it's structure is similar.

The tsconfig.json file is used to specify the root files and compiler options required to compile a TypeScript project. It is placed in the root of the project and is used to configure the TypeScript compiler. The presence of this file indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. The tsconfig.json file can include various options such as "compilerOptions" and "include" to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. The "compilerOptions" property can be omitted, in which case the compilerâ€™s defaults are used. This property contains the rules for the TypeScript compiler to enforce, such as "target" for specifying the ECMAScript version, "module" for specifying the module code generation, and "strictNullChecks" for enabling strict null checks. The "include" property specifies an array of filenames or patterns to include in the program, and these filenames are resolved relative to the directory containing the tsconfig.json file. This property is useful for specifying the files to be included in the program. The tsconfig.json file is useful for both individual work and team projects because it allows everyone to be on the same page about how to write their code. By including a tsconfig.json file, you can use the tsc command without any arguments in the terminal, making it easier to compile the TypeScript code.
