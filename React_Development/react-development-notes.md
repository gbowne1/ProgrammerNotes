# Learning React development

Since I started learning React development in 2017, I've learned a lot and since then the React development landscape has changed a lot. Back then, I was using the last few versions of React 16.

First of all, let me say I never felt like I grasped React development fully and am still learning React development.

There's some things I have learned via getting contributions to my React applications.

- The documentation has moved to react.dev

- Create React App and Facebook's React core team have basically deprecated the use of Create React App to scaffhold (aka creating an initial set of files for an application) in favor of Vite, NextJS.

React is typically used in conjunction or with other things called a stack or a tech stack.

A typical tech stack, whether full stack or not, consists of various components that work together to build an application. For a web application, a tech stack usually includes both frontend and backend technologies. Some common components of a tech stack are:

Frontend:

  Programming languages: such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

  Frameworks: like React, Angular, or Vue.js

  Libraries: such as Redux for state management in JavaScript applications

Backend:

  Frameworks: such as Express for Node.js or Spring for Java

  Databases: including SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB

  Servers: for managing client requests, such as Apache or Nginx

Other components:

  APIs: for integrating with third-party service(s). API's are usually JSON or YAML.

  Development tools: like Git for version control and Docker for containerization

These components can be combined in different ways to form various tech stacks, such as the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) or the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)

The choice of tech stack depends on the specific requirements of the project and the skills of the development team.
