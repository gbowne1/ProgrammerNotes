# ProgrammerNotes

This is a collection of Markdown notes written in Obsidian for programming, coding, software engineering, software development and it includes notes on C, C++, using and configuring VSCode and many other things programming related. Anyone is welcome to contribute to this Markdown repository and make corrections.

Keep in mind these notes are Open Source.  If I get it wrong, correct it in a PR or a issue or open a discussion.

Also, keep in mind these things are written just as I understand them, so they might be wrong.  They have been copied from either hand written or typed notes I have written to help me in case I forgot how to do something in programming.  If you use these things, Please verify that they work.

You don't have to use Obsidian to read this collection of notes, but it might help.
