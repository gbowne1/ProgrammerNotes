# Structuring a C++ program

There are indeed many possibilities of creating and structuring the files of a program with C++. In this text `folder` and `directcory` will be interchangeable and used as meaning the same thing, but will use the word `directory` to mean either one.

First of all, the structure of the program you've created should be maintainable by yourself and anyone involved in the project.

Why? It makes sense to not make so much work of yourself or anyone else, even if no one else may look at the code or the structure of your program and not just because it will save time.

There are some traditional C and C++ program structure conventions that will make this a bit easier for you and anyone else involved.

Here is a guide to creating a maintainable project in C++:

Create your project directory.

In that directory, create a directory called `src`.

Also in that directory, create a directory called `include`. All of your header files with the extension of `.h` will be placed. You also might choose to put the `include` directory inside the `src`. There is no distinct reasoning behind this, however this decision can be left up to the developer to choose which one. We will talk more about this in a bit.

In the main directory, create a main.cpp file. This will be the entrypoint to your program, and it will have a int main(); function. This entrypoint should stay in the root directory of the project.

From here you can and should try and modularize your program and its code.

This refers to the practice of dividing code into smaller, independent, and cohesive units that perform specific tasks or functions. These units, often called modules, components, or classes, allow for better organization, reusability, and maintainability of the code. Modular programming emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, with each module containing everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

When it comes to C++, modular programming involves dividing a computer program into separate sub-programs or modules, each containing the necessary code to execute a specific aspect of the program's functionality. This approach allows for better management of large programs, increased maintainability, readability of the code, and ease of making changes in the future or correcting errors

Modularizing a C++ project's code offers several benefits. It makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain by separating it into functions or modules, with each dealing with a specific aspect of the overall functionality.  Dividing the code into smaller, independent modules is a good practice for maintaining code readability and reusability. This can be done by separating functions, classes, and data structures into different files and organizing them logically.

This approach also reduces the chances of conflicts when multiple developers are working on the same codebase, leading to improved collaboration and productivity. Additionally, modularization can enhance code reusability, which is beneficial for future projects. However, it's important to note that excessive modularization can lead to code that is overly complex and difficult to manage, so at minimum try to be consistent.

The program should be subdivided into separate sub-programs or modules, with clear limitations and communication among them.

In C and C++, this can be achieved by dividing the code into smaller modules called functions or procedures, each handling a specific responsibility.

## Modularization

Modularization in a C++ project is important for several reasons:

    Easier Maintenance: By breaking down a large software program into smaller pieces, it becomes easier to develop, maintain, and understand the code. Each module can be developed and tested independently, reducing the complexity of the overall program

    Improved Readability: Modular programming makes your code easier to read as it separates it into functions that each deal with one aspect of the overall functionality. It can make your files a lot smaller and easier to understand, compared to monolithic code

    Increased Reusability: With modular programming, the same code or function can be used in multiple places. Instead of copying and pasting the code, you can call it from whatever module or library it's in, reducing code duplication and potential for error

    Faster Debugging and Updates: If there's a bug in the code or you need to update a specific function, you only have to fix it in one module, and everything that uses it gets updated right away. This reduces the risk of problems caused by slightly different implementations of the same functionality in different parts of your code

    Easier Collaboration: Modular programming is essential where multiple teams need to work on different components of a program. When you have multiple developers working on the same piece of code, it usually results in conflicts and issues which can slow down the team. Splitting the code between more functions, files, and/or repositories, means you can decrease the chances of conflicts happening

    Better Project Control: Modularization allows you to better control the program. Program control functions are used to subdivide and control the program. These functions are unique to the program being written

    Task Efficiency: Specific task functions are designed to be used with several programs. These functions perform a specific task and thus are usable in many different programs because the other programs also need to do the specific task. This increases the efficiency of the program

However, it's important to note that while modularization can greatly improve the manageability and efficiency of a project, it can also add complexity if not handled properly. For example, when a project is growing, it can add difficulty in finding specific implementations

Therefore, it's crucial to find a balance and structure the modules in a way that best suits the project's needs.

To modularize header files versus implementation files in C or C++, the general practice is to declare the functions, classes, and data structures in the header files, while the implementation details are defined in the implementation files (typically with a .cpp extension for
C++). This separation helps in organizing the code and allows for better reusability and maintainability. However, for small, simple functions or when using templates, the implementation might be included in the header file.

This separation helps in organizing the code and allows for better reusability and maintainability. However, there are cases where the implementation is included in the header file, such as for small, simple functions or when using templates. The decision on how to modularize depends on factors such as code complexity, project size, and performance considerations.

The decision to use a /src/ and /src/include/ directory versus a /include and a separate /src/ directory can depend on various factors. One advantage of the former is that it reduces the maintenance overhead for clients of the library, as they only need to be aware of one include directory, which reduces the risk of header name collisions

It also benefits implementors, as they can change the layout of their src directory without worrying about breaking library clients.

Additionally, it may have a small influence on build times, as having a smaller size folder with includes could potentially make the build process slightly faster.

On the other hand, the decision may also depend on the size of the project. For smaller projects, keeping the files in one directory tends to be more convenient, while for larger applications with hundreds or thousands of files, separating them into different directories becomes more practical.

The decision to use a /src/ and /src/include/ directory versus a /include and a separate /src/ directory can have both advantages and disadvantages.

Disadvantages of using a /src/ and /src/include/ directory:

- Complexity: It can add complexity to the project structure, especially for smaller projects

- Build System Configuration: It may require additional configuration in the build system to specify the include paths

- Verbose Include Paths: It can lead to verbose include paths, especially when using fine-grained modularization

How it can improve code organization:

- Reduces Maintenance Overhead: It reduces the maintenance overhead for clients of the library, as they only need to be aware of one include directory, reducing the risk of header name collisions

- Easier Reorganization: It makes it easier to reorganize the layout of the src directory without affecting library clients

- Influence on Build Times: It may have a small influence on build times, as having a smaller size folder with includes could potentially make the build process slightly faster

In the end, the choice between the two approaches is often a matter of preference and depends on the specific needs of the project. Both methods are valid, and it ultimately depends on the coding style and organizational preferences of the development team.

If your project will have a bunch of class files and keep this in in a practical and maintainable fashion.  Becuause many projects have a lot of files witih:

    ```cpp
    // other C++ code here

    class MyClass {

    }
    ```

The best practices for class files can be considered:

- Separation of Declaration and Definition: It is a common practice to separate the declaration of a class (interface) in a header file (.h or .hpp) and the definition (implementation) in a corresponding source file (.cpp).

- Namespace and Directory Structure: Organize the classes into namespaces and use a clear directory structure to reflect the namespaces. This helps in avoiding naming conflicts and makes the codebase more maintainable.

- Dependency Management: Use forward declarations to minimize dependencies between header files. This can help reduce compilation times and minimize the impact of changes.

- Use of Modules: With the introduction of C++20, modules provide a new way to organize code and manage dependencies. Consider using modules for better organization and encapsulation of code.

- Consistent Coding Style: Adopt a consistent coding style and adhere to best practices such as naming conventions, code formatting, and documentation. clang-format and clang-tidy will help out here immensely and we will cover this in another topic file or section.

- Unit Testing: Implement unit tests for the classes to ensure their correctness and maintainability over time.

For class files, it's a common practice to separate the declaration (in a header file) and the definition (in a source file). Organizing classes into namespaces and using a clear directory structure to reflect the namespaces helps in avoiding naming conflicts and makes the codebase more maintainable. Tools like clang-format and clang-tidy can help maintain a consistent coding style.

This will help you or anyone else working with your project maintain your project multiple class files in a practical and maintainable fashion, it is important to follow best practices such as separating declaration and definition, organizing code into namespaces, managing dependencies, adopting new language features like modules, maintaining a consistent coding style, and implementing unit tests.

If you are working with someone elses C++ project, do your best to try and follow the code style they have used. It is usually reasonably easy to spot how the project is laid out.

If your C++ program will be compiled to run on different platforms like Windows, Linux, and Mac, it's important to write platform-independent code whenever possible, or use preprocessor directives to handle platform-specific code.

Yes, there are tools that can help maintain consistency in a C++ program structure. One such tool is ReSharper C++, which provides a configurable code formatter, naming style settings, and sorting of #include directives to help maintain a consistent code style throughout the codebase

Additionally, using automatic static code analysis tools and following coding standards can also improve consistency and code quality in C++ programs

It's important to use meaningful names, maintain a consistent coding style, and follow best practices to ensure code consistency

In C++, the decision to separate the implementation from the declaration of a class is based on several factors. Here are some guidelines:

    Class Size and Complexity: If a class has a small number of non-trivial member functions, it may be preferable to make the member functions inline and place them beneath the class definition in the header file

    Header-Only Approach: In modern C++, classes or libraries are increasingly being distributed as "header-only," meaning all of the code for the class is placed in a header file. However, separating the declaration and implementation is a prerequisite to doing so

    Reusability and Compilation Time: Separating the class declaration into a header file and the implementation into a .cpp file facilitates reusability and can minimize recompilation times when an implementation detail changes

    Best Practice: It is a common practice to store class declarations in a separate file, called a header file, and store the member function definitions in a separate .cpp file with the same name as the class

By following these guidelines, you can make an informed decision on how to structure the implementation and declaration of a C++ class to maintain code organization and reusability.

Platform-specific code in a C++ program may be needed to handle differences in operating systems, hardware, or external libraries. For example, when creating a game engine that supports multiple operating systems and graphics APIs, the code for creating a window or initializing the renderer will be platform-specific

 One common approach to handling platform-specific code is to use conditional compilation, such as #ifdef WIN32 for Windows-specific code and #ifdef linux for Linux-specific code

 Another approach is to encapsulate platform-specific code in separate modules and use abstraction layers and design patterns to manage the differences

 When writing effective unit tests for C++ classes, several best practices should be followed:

    Keep tests small and focused: Each unit test should focus on testing a single unit of functionality in isolation, making them easier to maintain and identify the source of any failures

    Write tests before code: This practice, known as Test-Driven Development (TDD), helps clarify the desired functionality and makes it easier to write testable code

    Use descriptive test names: Clearly describe what is being tested in the name of the test to improve the readability of the tests and make it easier to understand their purpose

    Test one scenario per test: Each unit test should cover a single code path or scenario, making it easier to identify the cause of a test failure

    Automate unit tests: Unit tests should be automated to ensure they are run consistently and frequently as part of the development process

By following these best practices, developers can create effective unit tests for C++ classes, improving the quality and reliability of their code.

 Additionally, in the context of cross-platform mobile development, Flutter allows the creation of platform-specific code using platform channels, enabling the use of different languages (e.g., Kotlin, Java, Swift, Objective-C, C++) for specific platforms

## Pre-processor directives

Preprocessor directives are instructions provided to the C++ preprocessor before the actual compilation of code begins. They begin with a `#` symbol and are used to make source programs easier to change and compile in different execution environments. The preprocessor directives can include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. **#include**: This directive is used to include a file in the source code program. It can be a standard header file (e.g., `#include <iostream>`) or a user-defined header file (e.g., `#include "myHeaderFile.h"`). The preprocessor replaces the `#include` directive with the entire content of the specified header file [Source 0](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/), [Source 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-preprocessors/).

2. **#define**: This directive is used to define a macro, which is a rule or pattern that specifies how certain input sequences should be mapped to replacements. For example, you could define a macro that stands for a constant value (e.g., `#define PI 3.14159`). The preprocessor replaces all instances of the macro in the code with its defined value before the code is compiled [Source 0](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/), [Source 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-preprocessors/).

3. **#undef**: This directive is used to undefine a macro. If you have defined a macro using `#define` and you no longer need it, you can use `#undef` to remove its definition [Source 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-preprocessors/).

4. **#ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #else, #elif, #endif**: These conditional directives are used to compile a specific portion of the program or to skip compilation of a specific part based on certain conditions. For example, `#ifdef` checks if a certain macro is defined, and if so, the code within `#ifdef` and `#endif` is compiled. Similarly, `#ifndef` checks if a certain macro is not defined [Source 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-preprocessors/), [Source 4](https://codeforwin.org/c-programming/c-preprocessor-directives-include-define-undef-conditional-directives).

5. **#error**: This directive is used to generate a user-defined error message during compilation. If the preprocessor encounters an `#error` directive, it will report the error and stop the compilation process [Source 0](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/).

6. **#pragma**: This directive is used to offer machine- or operating system-specific compiler features, while maintaining overall compatibility with other compilers. They vary from compiler to compiler [Source 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-preprocessors/).

Here are some examples of preprocessor directives:

    #include <iostream>  // Include standard header file

    #define PI 3.14159   // Define a macro

    #ifdef PI           // Check if PI is defined
        std::cout << "PI is defined as " << PI << "\n";
    #else
        std::cout << "PI is not defined\n";
    #endif

    #undef PI           // Undefine a macro

    #ifndef PI          // Check if PI is not defined
        std::cout << "PI is not defined\n";
    #else
        std::cout << "PI is defined as " << PI << "\n";
    #endif

In this example, the `#include` directive includes the `iostream` header file. The `#define` directive defines a macro named `PI` with a value of `3.14159`. The `#ifdef` directive checks if `PI` is defined, and if so, it outputs a message. The `#undef` directive undefines `PI`, and the `#ifndef` directive checks if `PI` is not defined, and if so, it outputs a message.

Preprocessor directives are processed before the actual compilation of code begins. They are used to make source programs easier to change and compile in different execution environments [Source 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/preprocessor-directives?view=msvc-170), [Source 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4757107/preprocessor-directives).
