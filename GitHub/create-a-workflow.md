# GitHub Workflows

A GitHub workflow is a configurable automated process that runs one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked into your repository and will run when triggered by one or more events. The basic components of a workflow include one or more events that will trigger the workflow, one or more jobs that will execute on a runner machine and run a series of one or more steps, and each step can either run a script that you define or run an action, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.

Workflows are defined using YAML syntax and are stored as separate YAML files in your code repository, in a directory named .github/workflows. You can create a new GitHub workflow by creating a YAML file in your code repository and defining the workflow's components in the YAML file. There are different types of triggers available in GitHub workflows, including events that occur in your workflow's repository, events that occur outside of GitHub and trigger a repository_dispatch event on GitHub, scheduled times, and manual triggers. You can use the on.<event_name>.types keyword to define the type of activity that will trigger a workflow run. Most GitHub events are triggered by more than one type of activity.

A workflow in GitHub Actions is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked into your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule. On the other hand, a job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. A workflow can have one or more jobs, and each job can run on a different runner. Jobs run in parallel by default, but you can also configure them to run sequentially. You can debug a failed GitHub workflow by checking the logs and status of each step in the workflow. You can also use the if conditional statement to run a specific step only when a certain condition is met, and use the env keyword to set environment variables that can be used in your workflow. Some best practices for writing efficient GitHub workflows include using pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace, using caching to speed up your workflow, and using matrix strategies to run jobs with different configurations. It is also important to limit the number of jobs and steps in your workflow to reduce complexity and improve performance.

To troubleshoot a GitHub workflow that is not triggering, you can check the following:

    Check if the workflow YAML file is in the correct directory and has the correct name.
    Check if the workflow YAML file has any syntax errors.
    Check if the event that should trigger the workflow is configured correctly in the YAML file.
    Check if the workflow is enabled in the repository settings.

To rerun a failed GitHub workflow, you can go to the Actions tab in your repository, select the failed workflow run, and click on the "Re-run jobs" button. You can also use the gh run rerun command in the GitHub CLI to rerun a failed workflow run. To set up notifications for failed GitHub workflows, you can enable email or web notifications for GitHub Actions in your account settings. You can also choose to receive a notification only when a workflow run has failed. Additionally, you can set up a webhook that triggers when a workflow run completes, which could then notify you of a failure.
