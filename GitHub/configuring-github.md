# Configuring GitHub

This is not a note about configuring Git.  This is for configuring GitHub in a project.

To do this, Create a folder/directory in your project called `.github`.  This will house GitHub special files.

## GitHub Actions

Inside the `.github` folder create a folder called actions

GitHub actions are primarily written in YAML and have the file extension .yml or .yaml

## GitHub Workflows

Inside the .github folder/directory create a folder called `workflows`.

GitHub workflows are also primarily written in YAML and have the file extension .yml or .yaml, the same as an action would be.
