# About YAML

YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted

- It is designed to be easy to read and understand, and it uses a minimal syntax that intentionally differs from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
- YAML is a strict superset of JSON, which means that it can do everything that JSON can and more
- One major difference between YAML and JSON is that newlines and indentation actually mean something in YAML, as opposed to JSON, which uses brackets and braces
- YAML is a popular programming language because it is designed to be easy to read and understand. It can also be used in conjunction with other programming languages
- YAML files use a .yml or .yaml extension, and follow specific syntax rules
- YAML has features that come from Perl, C, XML, HTML, and other programming languages
- YAML also contains scalars, which are arbitrary data (encoded in Unicode) that can be used as values such as strings, integers, dates, numbers
- YAML is used in many applications, including configuration files, messages between applications, and saving application state
- It is used mainly in the DevOps domain, where it is widely used with well-known tools such as Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and many others
- YAML is also used by the Ansible automation tool to create automation processes, in the form of Ansible Playbooks
- YAML is a powerful language that can be used for a variety of purposes. If you're interested in learning more about YAML and its applications, there are many resources available online, including tutorials, documentation, and blog post

- YAML has features that come from Perl, C, XML, HTML, and other programming languages4
- YAML also contains scalars, which are arbitrary data (encoded in Unicode) that can be used as values such as strings, integers, dates, numbers
- YAML files are structured using indentation and whitespace, and are often used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted
- YAML files are made up of key/value pairs, which are commonly called a “hash” or a “dictionary”
- Sequences in YAML are represented by using the hyphen (-) and space, and are ordered and can be embedded inside a map using indentation4
- YAML also supports comments, which begin with the (#) character and must be separated from other tokens by whitespaces
