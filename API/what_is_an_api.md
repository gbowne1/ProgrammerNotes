# What is an API

REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It was introduced by computer scientist Roy Fielding in 2000. A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of the REST architectural style. It allows for interaction with RESTful web services and is based on a set of principles and constraints that promote simplicity, scalability, and statelessness in design. Key points about REST APIs include:

    Principles and Constraints: REST is not a protocol or a standard, but an architectural style with guiding principles and constraints that must be satisfied for a service interface to be referred to as RESTful. These principles include a client-server architecture, statelessness, cacheability, uniform interface, layered system, and code on demand.
    Interaction: REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. They make use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URIs to identify resources.
    Resource Model: A REST API consists of an assembly of interlinked resources, and it uses resource identifiers and hypermedia links to facilitate interactions between client and server components.

In summary, a REST API is an interface that follows the principles of the REST architectural style, providing a standardized and flexible approach to building web-based APIs. For more detailed information, you can refer to the provided sources.
