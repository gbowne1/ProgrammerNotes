# Serving a React app from Apache2

Here's an example of an Apache2 configuration file that serves a React application:

```xml
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    # Serve the static files generated by the React build process
    Alias /static /var/www/html/static
    <Directory /var/www/html/static>
    Require all granted
    </Directory>
    # Serve the index.html file for all requests that do not match a static file
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ /index.html [L]
</VirtualHost>
```
