# Node.js development notes

Node.js and JavaScript are related but serve different purposes. JavaScript is a scripting language
used for writing scripts on websites and is mostly used on the client-side. On the other hand,
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to run outside the browser,
primarily on the server-side. Here are the key differences between Node.js and JavaScript:

- JavaScript is a programming language used for writing scripts on websites, mostly on the client-side,
  while Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment primarily used on the server-side

- JavaScript can only be run in the browsers, while Node.js allows JavaScript code to run outside the browser.

- JavaScript is capable of adding HTML and playing with the DOM, while Node.js does not have the capability to add HTML tags

- JavaScript is used in frontend development, while Node.js is used in server-side development

- JavaScript can run in any browser engine, while Node.js uses the V8 engine to parse and run JavaScript

- JavaScript is used with frameworks like RamdaJS and TypedJS, while Node.js uses modules like Lodash and Express, which are imported from npm.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development, allowing you to write JavaScript code that runs on the server instead of in the browser. It is popular for creating web applications, APIs, and microservices, and has several libraries that can't be found in JavaScript, making certain operations easier.
