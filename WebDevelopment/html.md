# Learning HTML

Learning HTML is pretty easy.  While there are many web app frameworks that will handle this, traditional web development can be still done effectively by creating `.html` files, along with a few other types of files to include in your project.

Modern web development is typically done by creating a web app by using a framework.

We are going to discuss learning HTML in a top down fashion.

The modern HTML specification is HTML5, thus we are going to use this standard.

`<nav>`
`<aside>`
`<header>`
`<section>`
`<article>`
`<footer>`

`<h1>` to `<h6>`: Define headings of varying levels, with `<h1>` being the most important and `<h6>` the least.Use these tags to structure your content hierarchically.  For good SEO, I would not recommend using any thing more than `<h1>` to `<h3>`.

`<pre>`: Formats preformatted text, preserving whitespace and line breaks. Often used for code snippets or poems.
`<ul>`: Defines an unordered list of items.

`<blockquote>`: Represents a long excerpt from another source, typically indented and with quotation marks.

`<form>`: Defines a section of a webpage that allows users to submit data to the server.
`<label>`: Associates a label with a form element (like an input field) to explain its purpose.
`<input>`: Represents a single-line input field for various user interactions (text, password, checkbox, etc.).
`<textarea>`: Defines a multi-line text input area for users to enter larger amounts of text.
`<button>`: Creates a clickable button that can trigger actions when clicked.
`<fieldset>`: Groups related form elements visually, often with a common legend `<legend>` explaining the purpose of the group
