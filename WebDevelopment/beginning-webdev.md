# Web Development

Web Development or WebDev as it is sometimes called, has a wide variety of subjects.

There is a LOT to learn and cover.  I will do my best to cover a great deal of the basics. This is not intended to
be an all encompassing guide or tutorial.

You should at this point start learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming if you haven't already. This is the base
of Web Development. From there you can learn more advanced topics. There are lots of great resources to learn how
to program in these.

You should become familiar with whatever web browsers yourself or your project will be displayed using, especially
any devices you or your project may encounter.

## Choosing a editor or IDE for Web Development

This is a slightly controversial topic.  But, just about any editor or IDE will be able to support languages used
in web development.  There are a few exceptions.  There are a number of them that will work across different platforms
like Linux, Windows and Mac. There are quite a few options, depending on whether you want to use the
command line/shell/terminal/console to use your editor or use the GUI or user interface.  A number of developers
feel strongly about the editor or IDE they use.  You should use the one that gets the job done for you.

This should go without saying, but you should try a few out before you settle on one and do not rely on what
someone told you their editor or IDE is.  You might or might not like the first editor or IDE you choose
